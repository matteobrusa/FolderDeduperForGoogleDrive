## Folder deduper for Google Drive
It's quite easy to create duplicate folders in Google Drive. 
Let's say you have a folder called *January* in a *2016* folder and a folder *January* in a *2017* folder. 
If you move the first *January* folder into *2017* you'll get a duplicated folder. 
Unfortunately, Drive not only does not merge the folders as you would expect; it doesn't even warn you of the duplication.

Here's a simple tool that scans your drive for duplicated folders, (folders with the same name in the same parent folder), and merges them if you wish so.

This is a client side tool, keep the page open until the merge completes. 
Your Google Drive data and credentials are never sent to a 3rd party server.

This tool is a proof of concept, use it **at your own risk**.
